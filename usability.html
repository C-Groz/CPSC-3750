  <h2>Test Tasks and User Performance</h2>

  <table>
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Task</th>
        <th>User Performance</th>
        <th>Notes</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>Play and pause the song</td>
        <td>Completed the task in 5 seconds</td>
        <td>Will stated that this task was very easy because he is used to completing this task in other music software</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Create a title named "Task" after the 2-minute mark in the song </td>
        <td>Completed the task in 30 seconds</td>
        <td>Will took a moment to figure out how to navigate through the song. Had minor difficulty figuring out how to add a title </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Delete the "Task" title</td>
        <td>Will completed this task in 15 seconds</td>
        <td>Will took time for will to figure out that he has to click on the title first to delete it</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
